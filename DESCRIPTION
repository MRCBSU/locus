Description: Variational inference for sparse multivariate regression models
    that allow combined selection of covariates and associated responses in
    high-dimensional set-ups (Helene Ruffieux, Anthony C. Davison, Jorg Hager,
    Irina Irincheeva, 2017, Biostatistics). This software has been used with
    genetic data from molecular quantitative trait locus (QTL) problems with over
    500K single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), thousands of molecular expression
    levels and hundreds of individuals.
